A modified Kaprekar number is a positive whole number with a special property. If you square it, then split the number into two integers and sum those integers, you have the same value you started with.
Consider a positive whole number  with  digits. We square  to arrive at a number that is either  digits long or  digits long. Split the string representation of the square into two parts,  and . 
The right hand part,  must be  digits long. The left is the remaining substring. Convert those two substrings back to integers, add them and see if you get .
EXAMPLE 1= 5^2=25.   2+5=7 AND != 5(ORIGINAL NUMBER WE SQUARED)  THEREFORE 5 IS NOT A KAPREKAR NUMBER

EXAMPLE 2= 9^2=81. 8+1=9 WHICH IS =9(ORIGINAL NUMBER WE SQUARED) THEREFORE 9 IS A KAPREKAR NUMBER.
