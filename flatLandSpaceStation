Flatland is a country with a number of cities, some of which have space stations. 
Cities are numbered consecutively and each has a road of  length connecting it to the next city. It is not a circular route, so the first city doesn't connect with the last city.
Determine the maximum distance from any city to its nearest space station.

in the example above. there is a space station in each city so the maximum distance between a city and its space station are 0

n=5
c=[0,4]
maximum distance is 2.   0 distance in city 0, 1 distance in city 1, 2 distance in city 2, 1 distance in city 3 and 0 distance in city 4.  keep in mind we have a space station in city 0 and 4.  

loop through n and get attach city variable accordingly.  city 0-4 (n=5)  then compare the distance between space station by subtraction the city-space station.  take the minimum of the 2 distances and push them to an array.  then find the maximum number
within that array to find the max distance. 


n = 6
c=[0,1,2,4,3,5]


function flatlandSpaceStations(n, c) {
    let maxDistance = 0
    let distances=[]

    for (let i = 0; i < n; i++) {
        let city = i
        let minDistance=Infinity
        
        for (let j = 0; j <= c.length - 1; j++) {
           
            let Spacestationcity = c[j]
            
            let distance = Math.abs(city - Spacestationcity)
            minDistance = Math.min(minDistance, distance)
            
            
        }
        distances.push(minDistance)
        
        
    }
    maxDistance=Math.max(...distances)
    return maxDistance
}
console.log(flatlandSpaceStations(n,c))
