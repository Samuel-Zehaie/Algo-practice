return the element that occurs the most

we creat an object first. and set the maxcount to 0 as well as intialize mostFrequent variable 

we iterate through the array.  if the element doesn't appear in the object, we store it as a key value, the key being the element and the value being the amount of times we see it. 
if its the first time we see the element within the object, we set it to 1 however if we seen it before we increment count.

once we are one iterating, and we have our object filled with key-elment and value-count set.  
the if conditon asks if the value of that element is larger than the max count then set that max count as the value of that element. 
then we tie the mostFrequent variable the key(element) of that max count we just set. 


var majorityElement = function(nums) {
    let Object={};
    let maxcount=0
    let mostFrequent;
    for(let i=0; i<nums.length; i++){
        element=nums[i]
        if(!Object[element]){
            Object[element]=1
        }else{
            Object[element]++
        }
    if(Object[element]>maxcount){
        count=Object[element];
        mostFrequent=element;
    }
    }
    return mostFrequent;
    
};
