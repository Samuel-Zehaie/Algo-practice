how we solved this algo.
the way i understood is that we intially set res=0
we create an object literal of the alphabet where the letter corresponds to a number, A:1 B:2 C:3 and so on Z:26
the way we return its corresponding column number is. 0(res)*26+(number of the letter in the alphabe)t. example. ZY 0(initial res)*26+26(Z number in the alphabet)= 26  
intial output for Z is 26 so res is set to 26
then we work on the second letter 26(res after intial calculation)*26+25(Y number in the alphabet)=701  res is now 701 as you can see, that is the column title number of ZY.
then its just a matter of writing down the logic once we figure out the calculation on how we got the answer. 
a for loop to grab the letter string. we set res= res*26+number of the letter in the object literal we created. 

let columnTitle = "A"
//output 1

let columnTitle1 = "AB"
//output 28

let columnTitle2 = "ZY"
//output



var titleToNumber = function(columnTitle) {
    
    let res=0
    let map = {
        
            A: 1, B: 2, C: 3, D: 4, E: 5, F: 6, G: 7, H: 8, I: 9, J: 10,
            K: 11, L: 12, M: 13, N: 14, O: 15, P: 16, Q: 17, R: 18, S: 19,
            T: 20, U: 21, V: 22, W: 23, X: 24, Y: 25, Z: 26
        };
    for (let i = 0; i < columnTitle.length; i++){
        res = res * 26 + map[columnTitle[i]]
        
    }
    return res
    
};
console.log(titleToNumber(columnTitle));
console.log(titleToNumber(columnTitle1));
console.log(titleToNumber(columnTitle2));
